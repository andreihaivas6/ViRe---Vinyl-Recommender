# ViRe---Vinyl-Recommender

## Week 9 deliverables
* A general (service-oriented) architecture of the Web application to be developed + the overall design from the point of view of a software engineer (for example: main modules, software architecture diagrams, input/output data formats, data/task flows, etc.) and concerning the end users.
	
	`Included in the technical raport` - **/docs/raport.html**
* An OpenAPI specification regarding the REST API – or, alternatively, a schema for the GraphQL API – provided by the project, including various usage examples and pragmatic case studies - 
	
	`/docs/api-specification` (also included in the technical raport)
* A Scholarly HTML technical report (its digital content will be equivalent to a minimum of four A4 printed pages) consisting of preliminary considerations about the internal data structures/models to be used and the external data sources – e.g., public Web services and/or APIs – managed by the Web application to be developed. Also, explain how the solution conforms to the linked data principles.

	`Found at` - **/docs/raport.html**
* A public wiki associated to the WADe project repository should record the solution's progress. The content must be available in English language and minimally tagged with project, infoiasi, wade, and web.

	`Found at` - **README.md**
